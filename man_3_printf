NAME
    _printf()
    Allows the display of numeric values, characters and text strings on the screen.
    
SYNOPSIS
    #include "holberton.h"

    printf format output conversion [ARGUMENT]...
    int _printf(const char *format, ...)

DESCRIPTION
    Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, FORMAT controls the output as in C _printf.
    In the control string we indicate how the subsequent arguments will be displayed. We can also enter a text string (without arguments), or combine both possibilities, as well as escape sequences.
    
    In case we use arguments we must indicate in the control string as many modifiers as arguments we are going to present.
    The modifier is composed of the % character followed by a conversion character, which indicates what type of data it is.
    
    FORMAT controls the output as in C printf. Interpreted sequences are:
    %c A single character
    %% A single character %
    %d A signed integer, in decimal base
    %i A signed integer, in decimal base
    %u An unsigned integer, in decimal base
    %o An integer in octal base
    %x An integer in hexadecimal base
    %X An integer in hexadecimal base %x An integer in hexadecimal base
    %s A character string
    %p A memory pointer or address


EXAMPLES
    /* Use of the _printf() statement 1.

	#include "holberton.h"

	main() /* Output to screen integers */
	{
		int a=20, b=10;
		_printf("The value of a is %d",a);
		_printf("The value of b is %d\n",b);
	}
